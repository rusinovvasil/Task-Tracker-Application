Mark as Completed:

Include a checkbox or button to mark tasks as completed and visually distinguish them.
Filter and Sorting:

Allow users to filter tasks based on categories, due dates, or priorities. Implement sorting options based on different criteria.
Local Storage:

Use local storage to persist tasks, so users can close and reopen the application without losing data.
Responsive Design:

Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
Technologies:

HTML, CSS for the structure and style of the application.
JavaScript for dynamic functionality and handling user interactions.
Optionally, you can use a front-end framework like React, Vue, or Angular to build a more structured and modular application.
